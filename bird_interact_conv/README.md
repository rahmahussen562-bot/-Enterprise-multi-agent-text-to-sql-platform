# Bird-Interact Conversational Module

This module implements the conversation-based interaction system for the BIRD-Interact project, focusing on natural language interactions with database systems.

**What is it?**  
A test that sees how well an evaluated system (S) can communicate with a user simulator (U) to solve user tasks via good SQL queries.

---

#### Step-by-step flow

1. **Ambiguous task**  
   *U* starts with a task with several ambiguities.

2. **Clarification round**  
   *S* can ask follow-up questions until it thinks it understands, then sends a SQL query.  
   • If the query is wrong, *S* gets one more chance (a “debugging”) to fix it.  
   • If both attempts fail, the test stops.

3. **Follow-up round**  
   If the first question was solved, *U* immediately asks a related follow-up query.  
   *S* writes a new SQL query and again has one debugging if needed.

4. **Turn limit**  
   The back-and-forth in the clarification round is limited by two things:  
   • how many ambiguity points were marked in the task, plus  
   • a small extra “user patience” (i.e., extra turns) allowance with the default being 3.

---

#### How scoring works

For a batch of tasks we count how many times *S* succeeds in each case:

| Situation | What counts as a win? | Reward added per win |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Clarification, first try | Solved without using the debugging | **0.7** |
| Clarification, after debugging | Solved on the second try | **0.5** |
| Follow-up, first try | Solved without using the debugging | **0.3** |
| Follow-up, after debugging | Solved on the second try | **0.2** |

Add up the points and divide by the number of tasks.  
The closer the final number is to **1**, the better the system:

* High points = solves quickly with few mistakes.  
* Low points = needs debuggings or can’t solve at all.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

```bash
cd /YOUR-PTOJECT-ROOT/BIRD-Interact/bird_interact_conv
mkdir data
cd data
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/bird-interact-lite
# Combine with GT fields (contact us for access) into bird_interact_data.jsonl
```

After getting the ground-truth fields by emailing us, use the following script to combine the public data with the ground truth and test cases:

Take the full version as an example:
(1) Run:
```bash
python combine_public_with_gt.py /path/to/bird-interact-full/bird_interact_data.jsonl /path/to/bird_interact_full_gt_kg_testcases_08022.jsonl /path/to/bird_interact_data.jsonl  # bird_interact_full_gt_kg_testcases_08022.jsonl is the data of ground-truth fields, which is obtained by emailing us.
```
This will create a new file at `/path/to/bird_interact_data.jsonl` with the combined data. 

(2) Then replace the original public data with the combined data:

```bash
cp /path/to/bird_interact_data.jsonl /path/to/bird-interact-full/bird_interact_data.jsonl
```

Same for the other versions: bird-interact-lite, mini version, etc. Just set correct paths for the public data and the ground truth and test cases, and then replace the original public data with the combined data.



### 2. Environment Start

Please refer to [README.md](../README.md#environment-setup) for the environment setup for both `a-Interact` and `c-Interact`.

Start the evaluation environment:
```bash
cd /YOUR-PTOJECT-ROOT/BIRD-Interact/env/
docker compose exec bird_interact_eval bash
cd ../bird_interact_conv/
```

### 3. API Configuration

You need to setup the model name (eg., **gpt-4o-2024-08-06**) with the API key in the `code/config.py` file


## Running Experiments (BIRD-Interact-Lite)
**If you want to eval on bird-interact-full:**
   - Change the host in `BIRD_Interact/evaluation/src/postgresql_utils.py` (`DEFAULT_DB_CONFIG`) from `bird_interact_postgresql` to `bird_interact_postgresql_full`. 

   ```bash
   # Run the conversation pipeline, need to set the API key in code/config.py
   cd pipeline
   # Line 12: project_root="YOUR-ROOT" should be changed to your root (for example: "/app")
   # And you may tune the parameters starting from line 8.
   bash run_gpt.sh
   ```
Output directory: `results/`

## Running Experiments (BIRD-Interact-Full)
- Dataset: use the Full dataset and DB metafiles instead of the Lite one:
- Host: Change the host in `evaluation/src/postgresql_utils.py` from `bird_interact_postgresql` to `bird_interact_postgresql_full` to ensure that the SQL is executed on the Full DB.
- User simulator prompt: Use the `prompts_for_bird_interact_full.py` file instead of the `prompts.py` file.

## Components

### Code Module
- `sql_parser.py`: Handles parsing and validation of SQL queries
- `wrap_up_sql.py`: Formats and finalizes SQL queries
- `infer_api_system.py`: Manages system-side conversation logic
- `infer_api_user_1.py` & `infer_api_user_2.py`: Different user simulation strategies
- `collect_response.py`: Utilities for gathering and processing responses
- `call_api.py`: Interface for API interactions

### Pipeline
The `run_gpt.sh` script orchestrates the conversation flow, managing:
- User query processing
- System response generation
- SQL query execution
- Response collection and evaluation

### Prompts
Please use the `prompts_for_bird_interact_full.py` when using the Bird-Interact-Full dataset. The `prompts.py` file is only used for Bird-Interact-Lite, which contains templates and prompts used for:
- User query generation
- System response formatting
- SQL query construction
- Error handling and clarification
- You are welcome to use your own prompts when meeting our task settings.

### Results
Results from conversation runs are stored in the `results/` directory.
